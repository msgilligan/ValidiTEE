= ValidTEE Container Build Instructions

== Setup

. Make sure you have Docker or Podman correctly installed.


== Build the Container Image for Compiling TAs.

Due to a bug in the OP-TEE build, if you are on a ARM64 host, you will need to use an AMD64 container
to build the TA.

To build a container image that can build the Rust TA and client apps, run:

. `./make-builder-image.sh`

Note that this script forces the container engine to use an AMD64 container, so the build
will be relatively slow on your ARM64 machine. Fortunately, there is a lot less building going on
when you build your TA and CA.

== Build your TA and CA with the builder image.
